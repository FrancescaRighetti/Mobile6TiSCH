# SCENARIOS:

## 1. all BRs share the same schedule:
- what happens if I change channelsUsed?
- what happens if I change the ui,di of the nodes? (To have conflicts on timeslots)

## 2. the same as before introducing the mobility prevision

## 3. include GA based placement

## 4. introduce different policies to handle redundancy:
- STATIC ALLOCATION: staticly increase u<sub>i</sub> and d<sub>i</sub>
- DYNAMIC USAGE OF STATIC RESOURCES: dedicated timeslots for retransmissions
- COVERAGE-BASED APPROACH: 2-coverage


## 5. (Retransmissions included later on!)
